	Description: Simulation of a Quantum Harmonic/Anharmonic Oscillator using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo 
		techniques to advance the simulation for my Masters Project.This is the main class where all of 
		the main functions will be called from and the final results collected and outputted from. Here
		I shall be using natural units such that h_bar = c = 1. Beginning with a 1d system.
